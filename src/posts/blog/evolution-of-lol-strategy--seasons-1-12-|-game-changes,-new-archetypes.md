# The Evolution of Strategy in League of Legends: From Season 1 to Season 12

## Introduction

### The Game and its Impact

League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that has significantly impacted the esports scene since its inception in 2009. With over 100 million active players each month, LoL has become a cultural phenomenon and a cornerstone of competitive gaming. Its lasting appeal can be attributed to various factors, including its dynamic gameplay, engaging lore, and, most importantly, the ever-evolving strategies that players employ to secure victory.

### The Importance of Strategy

Strategy plays a crucial role in LoL, influencing player engagement, satisfaction, and the overall competitive landscape. As the game progresses through different seasons, strategic changes occur due to a variety of factors, such as new champion releases, game patches, and evolving player preferences. Understanding and adapting to these changes is essential for both casual and competitive players, as it can mean the difference between triumph and defeat.

In this blog post, we'll explore the evolution of strategy in League of Legends, from its earliest days in Season 1 to the modern strategies of Season 12.

## Main Sections

### Section 1: Early Season Strategies (Seasons 1-3)

#### The Early LoL Meta and Dominant Strategies

The early League of Legends meta was characterized by a few dominant strategies and champions that were considered overpowered or highly effective in specific roles. In Season 1, for example, the mid lane was dominated by champions like Annie and Ryze, while the bottom lane featured a mix of marksmen and supports.

#### The Rise and Fall of Specific Champions and Roles

Throughout Seasons 1 to 3, various champions and roles experienced meteoric rises and falls in popularity due to numerous factors, such as balance changes, new releases, and emerging strategies. For instance, Season 2 saw the rise of jungle-oriented strategies, with champions like Maokai and Skarner becoming popular picks. Additionally, the support role gained prominence, thanks to champions like Nunu and Sona.

#### Shift in Strategy Due to Game Patches and Updates

As the game progressed, Riot Games introduced game patches and updates to maintain a balanced and engaging environment. These changes often led to significant shifts in strategy, as players adapted to the new landscape. For example, the introduction of the "jungle camp" system in Season 2 prompted a new wave of jungle-focused strategies, while the removal of the "recommended items" feature forced players to make more informed decisions about their builds.

### Section 2: The Emergence of New Playstyles (Seasons 4-6)

#### Introduction of New Strategies and Impact of Competitive Play

As LoL entered Seasons 4 to 6, new strategies began to emerge, driven by the growth of competitive play and the increasing specialization of professional teams. These strategies often revolved around unique champion combinations, innovative item builds, and unconventional playstyles that pushed the boundaries of the established meta.

#### Growth of Role-Specialization and Rise of Professional Teams

During these seasons, role-specialization became increasingly important, as players began to focus on honing their skills in specific areas of the game. This shift led to the rise of professional teams, such as TSM, Fnatic, and SK Telecom T1, that capitalized on the strengths of their rosters and developed unique strategies to outmaneuver their opponents.

#### Effects of International Events such as World Championships on Strategy

International events, like the World Championships, played a significant role in shaping the LoL meta during Seasons 4-6. These high-profile tournaments served as a testing ground for new strategies, as teams from around the world showcased their innovative approaches to the game. For instance, the introduction of the "double jungle" strategy in Season 5 disrupted the traditional 1-1-2 composition, providing teams with additional map pressure and objective control.

### Section 3: The Impact of Game Changes (Seasons 7-9)

#### Influence of Significant Game Updates on Strategy

Seasons 7 to 9 saw several significant game updates that had a profound impact on LoL's strategic landscape. These updates, such as item and rune reworks, forced players to reevaluate their strategies and adapt to the new environment.

#### Changes in the Meta and Player Preferences due to Updates

These updates led to changes in the meta and player preferences, as champions and roles that had previously fallen out of favor returned to prominence. For example, the introduction of the new rune system in Season 8 allowed for more diverse and creative builds, while the item reworks in Season 9 encouraged players to experiment with different item combinations.

#### Introduction of New Champions and Subsequent Adaptations in Strategy

During this period, Riot Games released several new champions that significantly impacted the game's strategy. These champions, such as Kayn, Pyke, and Neeko, offered unique abilities and playstyles that required players to adjust their strategies to accommodate the new additions.

### Section 4: The Rise of Modern Strategies (Seasons 10-12)

#### Shift in Strategies and the Rise of New Archetypes

As LoL progressed into Seasons 10 to 12, strategies continued to evolve, giving rise to new archetypes and playstyles. These changes were driven by a variety of factors, including balance changes, community feedback, and emerging trends in the competitive scene.

#### Adaptation of Strategies in Various Game Modes

Modern LoL strategies are not limited to the traditional Summoner's Rift mode. Players have adapted these strategies for various game modes, such as Clash and ranked, to maximize their chances of success. For instance, the "cheese" strategies that involve unconventional picks and surprise factors have proven effective in Clash matches, where team coordination and communication are crucial.

#### Role of Community Feedback and Balance Changes in Modern LoL Strategy

The LoL community plays a significant role in shaping modern strategies, thanks to the active feedback channels and the ongoing dialogue between players and developers. Balance changes, in particular, have a significant impact on strategy, as they encourage players to reevaluate their champion choices, item builds, and playstyles.
